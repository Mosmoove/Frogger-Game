# Frogger-Game

Frogger is a classic arcade game where the player controls the frog and has to dodge hazardous roads and rivers.


# Rules of Frogger:
- You will have a limited amount of time to reach the ending block (red square) before your time is up.
- If you get hit by a car( black squares) or run into a hazardous river (blue squares), you lose the game and the user will have to try again from the beginning.
- You can move the frog anywhere inside the grid box, except for the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point.
